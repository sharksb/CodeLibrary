  //step 1:the index of it want to compare  with anthor length  in order to judge is it circled
  //eg:
  for(var i=0;i<a.length;i++){  
    CircleItself();
    num = i;
     function CircleItself(!num== b.length){
           method:{}
           num++;
           CircleItself()//circle itself  until  mun==b.length
     }
